# ChatApp---ChatterBox-Connect
The chat application features a user authentication system where new users must sign up and existing users log in with their email and password. Upon successful sign-up or login, users are directed to the usersâ€™ area, where they can see a list of other signed-up users with their full names, profile images, and active status.
